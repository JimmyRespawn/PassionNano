Hi dear user,

I’m very sorry you encounter this problem.

The reason why you get this message may be:

1. You use this app too frequently in a very short time. The server might consider you as an bot and ban you from getting data. 

Solution: Simply restart your router or modem to get another IP address will resolve this problem. But if you are getting the same IP address the problem will remain. 

2. Your ISP or country block the data source. 

Solution: in this case, you have to contact your ISP( internet service provider) to unblock Giant Bomb site to enable the app. 

3. You have bad internet connection.

Solution: try another time when your network environment get better. 

4. Worked before, keep getting this error message now.

Solution: Please contact me via e-mail( you can find my mail in wpappx.com. Tell me the app no longer work. I’ll look into it see if it’s a common issue. If it is , I’ll work on new update to resolve this issue. If it isn’t, I’m sorry you’ll have to see 1-3 and try to resolve this issue by yourself.
