## Privacy Policy

**Effective Date**: April 6, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how **IPTV Fluent** ("we", "our", or "the App") handles user data and respects your privacy.

## 1. No Personal Data Collected

IPTV Fluent Player does **not collect, store, or share** any personally identifiable information (PII) about you.
We do **not** request access to your personal files, contacts, photos, location, or any other sensitive information.

## 2. Internet Connectivity

The App uses your internet connection solely for the purpose of streaming media and downloading updates. No personal data is transmitted during this process.

## 3. App Usage Analytics

To improve app stability and user experience, IPTV Fluent Player integrates anonymous telemetry tools, such as:

- **App Analytics**

- **Visual Studio App Center**

These tools help us:

- Identify and fix bugs or crashes

- Understand general usage patterns

All analytics data collected is **aggregated and anonymized**, and does **not include any user-specific or device-identifiable information**.

## 4. Third-Party Sharing

We do **not** share any data â€” personal or anonymous â€” with third-party advertisers or marketers. The only third-party services used (e.g., for crash analytics) are strictly for diagnostic and stability purposes.

## 5. Data Security

Since **no personal data** is collected, stored, or transmitted, there is no risk of data leakage or misuse of your personal information through this App.

The App does **not** knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If we discover that we have unintentionally gathered such information, we will take steps to delete it immediately.
