This Privacy Policy describes how **IPTV Fluent Player** ("we", "our", or "the App") handles user data and respects your privacy.

## 1. No Personal Data Collected

IPTV Fluent Player does **not collect, store, or share** any personally identifiable information (PII) about you.
We do **not** request access to your personal files, contacts, photos, location, or any other sensitive information.

## 2. Internet Connectivity

All analytics data collected is **aggregated and anonymized**, and does **not include any user-specific or device-identifiable information**.

We do **not** share any data â€” personal or anonymous â€” with third-party advertisers or marketers. The only third-party services used (e.g., for crash analytics) are strictly for diagnostic and stability purposes.

## 5. Data Security

Since **no personal data** is collected, stored, or transmitted, there is no risk of data leakage or misuse of your personal information through this App.
