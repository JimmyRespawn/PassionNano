`Settings` Overview in Download Manager

## General

### Theme

The app supports Light, Dark, and Auto themes.

### Enable Notifications

The app will send system `Toast` notifications when a download is completed.

### Change Language

The app supports around 20 built-in languages. If the change does not take effect, it may indicate that the corresponding language pack is not installed on your system.

## Downloads

### Download UA (User-Agent)

You can modify the User-Agent in cases where certain platforms impose restrictions.

### Change Download Directory

You can change the default download location; previously downloaded files will not be affected.

### Multi-threading

Supports up to 5 simultaneous threads per file, accelerating download speeds.

### Batch Download

If multiple online files need to be downloaded in bulk and their file extensions follow a certain pattern, you can use the batch wildcard feature to download them all at once.

## Browser

### File Type Detection

The built-in browser supports detecting various file types. If there are more specific file types, you can manually add them, typically separated by a space, such as `mp2 m4a`.

### Browser Engine

The app offers `Webview1` and `Webview2` as engines for detecting download links within the built-in browser. Typically, this setting does not require modification.
