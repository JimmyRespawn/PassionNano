Download Manager is a native download application for Windows 10/11, designed with a Fluent interface.

The motivation behind developing this application stemmed from the lack of a lightweight downloader with a native UWP interface between the Aria-wrapped GUI and traditional IDM. Additionally, I personally needed an out-of-the-box download manager, which led to the creation of this app.

Next, I will introduce how to use this application.
