## Q&A Trouble shoot

### Instant crash after loading channels

Please install the graphic driver on the device. The app uses software decoder to play video.

### Video glitch during streaming

Switch playback engine in `Settings`.

### Unable to streaming video in background

Ditto. Switch to `System` playback engine in `Settings`.

### Random crash while switching between channels

Ditto again. `VLC` might crash if there is bad connection during the channel switch.

### Unable to parse the channel list

There are two circumstances:

- 1. The m3u/8 list does not follow the guideline. There is nothing we can do about this.

- 2. Our parsing logic is unable to parse the list. Please send the list to us via mail if it's convenient for you.

### Default system players does not load user agent required channel

Currently only other two video engines support user agent required channel. Please change video playback engine in settings if you wish to play channels like this.
