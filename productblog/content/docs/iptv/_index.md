## Q&A Trouble shoot

### Instant crash after loading channels

Please install the graphic driver on the device. The app uses software decoder to play video.

### Unable to streaming video in background

You may exit the playing page to library page in order to release the video comsumption, then direct the app to the background.

### Video glitch during streaming

Switch playback engine in `Settings`.

### Random crash while switching between channels

Ditto. `VLC` might crash if there is bad connection during the channel switch.

### Unable to parse the channel list

There are two circumstances:

- 1.The m3u/8 list does not follow the guideline. There is nothing we can do about this.

- 2.Our parsing logic is unable to parse the list. Please send the list to us via mail if it's convenient for you.

### Default system players does not load user agent required channel

Currently only other two video engines support user agent required channel. Please change video playback engine in settings if you wish to play channels like this.

### Is there mobile version for IPTV Fluent

iOS and iPad verison is available at app store. [Click here to download for free](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6744343679?pt=127753526&mt=8&ct=officialwebsite&platform=iphone).

### Media Hub for Emby, Jellyfin and WebDAV

Starting at v1.0.34 for Windows & Xbox version. The app supports Emby, Jellyfin, WebDAV and DLNA as media servers.

Access it by clicking the top right botton in the `Library` Page.

The media info is accessible for Emby and Jellyfin servers. Currently there is no poster wall for medias yet. We'll see how it performs as media player now.

The app is aiming to be a multi-media hub as Infuse and Kodi did in iOS and Android.

P.S. On console the app is using server transcoding for 4K HEVC videos due to codec issue. Other videos are using the native hardware decode.
