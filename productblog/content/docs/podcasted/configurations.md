### Change Language  

Supports about 10 built-in languages. If the change does not take effect, it means the corresponding language pack is not installed on the system.  

### Menu Position  

The default menu position is on the left, but it can be moved to the top based on user preference.  

## Playback  

### Playback Speed  

Allows adjusting the audio playback speed within a range of 0.5 to 3.0.
