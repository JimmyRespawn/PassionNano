Our vision is to build the best native app experience

- on the Windows and Xbox platforms by adopting the latest technology provided by Microsoft.
- on the iOS, iPadOS and TvOS provided by Apple.

Support the projects by

- Sharing the apps with the community
- Purchasing the Pro version
- Leaving 5-star ratings in the store
- [Buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/jimmyrespawn)

To follow the app development updates, we will soon open a Telegram announcement channel.
