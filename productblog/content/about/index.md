Our vision is to build the best native app experience on Windows and Xbox platform which adopts the latest technology provided by MSFT.

To support the projects via ① sharing the apps to community, ② purchasing Pro version and ③ leaving 5-star ratings in the store.

To follow the app development updates, we will soon open a Telegram announcement channel.
